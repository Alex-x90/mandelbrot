# mandelbrot
A javascript implementation of the mandelbrot set. Uses the canvas object with specific pixel controls to generate the current image. Has controls at the top of program. "useCanvasSize" is a bool which swaps between the size you give in "size" or the size of the window. "scale", "panX" and "panY" are used to move/zoom the window. "sharpness" controls how many iterations it goes through before deciding the pixel doesn't exit the function and should be a black pixel. It needs to be increased the further you increase scale.
